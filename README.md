Octoprint for Me3D

Octoprint for Me3D is a plugin that extends the core functionality of the very excellent Octoprint/OctoPi by Gina Häußge (https://github.com/foosel). It’s intended to add all the basic functionality required to setup, operate, remotely monitor and maintain multiple Me2 3D printers within the same network.
